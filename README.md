## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop accurate models that can predict salary based on occupation, education, and experience-related features. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, evaluation, and tuning.

The main objectives of the project are:
- Exploring and understanding the dataset
- Performing data cleaning and preprocessing
- Applying various machine learning algorithms for salary prediction
- Evaluating and comparing the performance of different models
- Selecting the best-performing model and fine-tuning it
- Providing insights and recommendations based on the results

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a pre-processed and cleaned dataset obtained from reliable [sources](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hekkta/salary-predictor). It contains information about monthly salaries and related attributes of individuals. The features include gender, education level, years of experience, and more.

## Installation

To run the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary data file, `salary_cleaned.csv`, placed in the appropriate location.
2. Run the main code file, `salary_prediction.py`, to train and evaluate the models.
3. View the results, including MAE, MSE, and R-squared scores, printed in the console.
4. Explore the code and modify it as needed for further analysis or experimentation.

## Results

The project evaluates and compares the performance of three machine learning models: Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. The key evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R-squared).

Based on the evaluation, the best-performing model for salary prediction is the Gradient Boosting model, which achieved the lowest MAE and MSE values and the highest R-squared score on the testing set.
